# Chatroom using modern libraries

This project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app-typescript](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript).

The purpose of this is to see how to use modern web libraries together in a single, cohesive web app. Sometimes it's more helpful to see real world examples, because those are the places we run into questions about design or architecture choices.
It also shows how to hook socket.io with RabbitMQ for one event.

## Libraries

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Blueprint.js](http://blueprintjs.com/)
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- [OpenID Connect (Login with Google)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openid-client)
- [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint)

I also have [an example](server/global.d.ts) of how to add missing type definitions for libraries that don't already have any.

## Run

Make sure that you have docker installed. Execute the following:

    $ docker-compose up --build
